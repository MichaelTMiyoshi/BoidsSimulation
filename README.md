# BoidsSimulation

Simulation of Boids

(School project)

see [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) for explanation of what boids are.

## Releases

There is a release of the Boids Simulation for OSX (v1.0).  [Releases](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/BoidsSimulation/releases)

### Goals:
* Successful use of GitHub and Unity (learned a lot about Git, GitHub, and Unity)
* Successful Boids simulation (nuances not done, but the simulation is somewhat reasonable)
* HUD with ability to put in obstacles (no obstacles in v1.0)

### Notes:
* When starting the repo from Unity, the project is at the root of the repo.  (Not sure I like this.  Not sure how to change this either.)

Deleted the project and then changed the way I created the repo.  Follow the directions in [TerminalGit.md](TerminalGit.md).
