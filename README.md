# BoidsSimulation

Simulation of Boids

(School project)

see [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) for explanation of what boids are.

### Goals:
* Successful use of GitHub and Unity
* Successful Boids simulation
* HUD with ability to put in obstacles

### Notes:
* When starting the repo from Unity, the project is at the root of the repo.  (Not sure I like this.  Not sure how to change this either.)

Deleted the project and then changed the way I created the repo.  Follow the directions in [TerminalGit.md](TerminalGit.md).
